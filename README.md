Twitter Timeline Example
========================

A first example (will need some tweaks; as I am still learning) of using Dart on command-line to get your timeline updates from Twitter and save to a JSON file. 


### To Do:
1. Look at handling the updates.json file when it reaches a certain size, as this will cause problems in the future.
2. Update to use a database.
